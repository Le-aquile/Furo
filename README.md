## Key Features ✨

### 1. **Deep Learning** 🧠  
Furo includes a fully customizable neural network module, allowing users to:  
- Build multi-layer neural networks by specifying layers, neurons, and activation functions.  
- Use built-in activation functions such as **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, **Tanh**, **Leaky ReLU**, and **Swift** for various tasks.  
- Train models using backpropagation to understand the mechanics of learning.  

This module is ideal for classification, regression, and custom neural network experiments. 🎯

### 2. **Linear Regression** 📊  
Furo simplifies linear regression with an intuitive implementation:  
- Easily fit data to a line using the **least squares method**.  
- Retrieve slope and intercept coefficients to understand data relationships.  
- Predict outcomes with a straightforward interface.  

This feature is a perfect starting point for analyzing trends and patterns in datasets. 🔎

### 3. **Meta-Learning** 🤔  
Meta-learning, or "learning to learn," is supported through a **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** module. With Furo, you can:  
- Train models across multiple tasks, adapting quickly to new data.  
- Understand the principles of gradient-based meta-learning.  
- Experiment with parameter updates at both the task and meta-level.  

This feature is excellent for exploring advanced machine learning concepts like task generalization and transfer learning. 🔄

### 4. **Decisional Trees** 🌳  
Furo’s decision tree implementation provides a visual and logical approach to classification:  
- Build decision trees that split data based on features and thresholds.  
- Calculate **Gini impurity** to ensure optimal splits and accurate predictions.  
- Support for depth control and interpretability for clear understanding.  

This module is highly useful for tasks where interpretability and simplicity are key, such as customer segmentation or medical diagnoses. 🩺

### 5. **Perceptrons** 🔲  
The perceptron module allows you to build and train the simplest form of a neural network:  
- Implement binary classifiers using a single-layer perceptron.  
- Understand how weights and biases interact to classify data.  
- Experiment with small datasets to gain a solid foundation in machine learning.  

This is an ideal starting point for users exploring neural networks for the first time. 👶
